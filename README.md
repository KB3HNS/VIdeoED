## VIdeoED
Simple linear video editor written in Python using mplayer as the back-end.

This was a tool that I wrote back in 2008 while unemployed during the "Great Recession".  I had an earlier interest in television production and wanted to get into some digital video editing.  There weren't any good tools available in the FOSS market but MPlayer - which I was a contributor to - was, at the time, an up-and-coming video player and transcoder.  I took the time to teach myself the Python programming language to create a GUI to interact with the mplayer / mencoder back-end using their "pipe" interface.  Both the mplayer project as well as the version of PyGTK that this was written are now defunct.

This is another project that was originally on my long-lost Sourceforge page.  Bringing over to GitHub for memento purposes.

I will state ahead of time - the code quality is quite bad as this was my very first foray into Python having spent several years programming in C and Perl.

I have no intention of maintaining this code as very little is still useable.
